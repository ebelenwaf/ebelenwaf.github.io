With the advent of deep learning models, the translation of several languages has been performed with high accuracy and precision. In spite of the development in machine translation techniques, there is very limited work focused on translating low-resource African languages, particularly Nigerian languages. Nigeria is one of the most populous countries in Africa with diverse language and ethnic groups. In this paper, we survey the current state of the art of machine translation research on Nigerian languages with a major emphasis on neural machine translation techniques. We outline the limitations of research in machine translation on Nigerian languages and propose future directions in increasing research and participation.",

abstract = {Named Data Networking (NDN), an emerging Internet architecture is altering the basics of the networking model by making content directly addressable and routable. NDN changes the communication model by shifting from the current host-centric model to a content-centric model naming each content object hierarchically instead of using IP addresses. This change enables data consumers to request content using application-layer names that optimize network traffic and allow data security directly at the network layer, making the content of every data packet verifiable and enabling resilient communication in dynamic network environments, such as mobile ad hoc networks. This paper presents the concepts of NDN architecture and a comprehensive overview of emerging application use cases of the technology for secure data communications. We discuss the integration of NDN with the current Internet protocol and highlight how NDN works as a facilitator for addressing numerous concerns related to unique applications. Furthermore, we highlight the trust management and security aspects of NDN. Finally, we outline challenges relating to NDN adoption and present some proposed solutions.},
