Hello :wave:, welcome to my academic webpage! I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Computing Sciences](https://www1.villanova.edu/university/liberal-arts-sciences/programs/computing-sciences.html), [Villanova University.](https://www1.villanova.edu/university.html) My research interests spans across machine learning/natural language processing, information visualization, health informatics, data provenance, and Internet of Things (IoT)/cyber-physical systems security. 


I :mortar_board: graduated with my Ph.D in Computer Science from the [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://cea.howard.edu/academics/departments/department-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science), Howard University under the supervision of [Dr.Gedare Bloom ](https://gedare.github.io/).  For my dissertation, I explored the applications of data provenance to the Internet of Things. A brief description of this project can be found <a href="./assets/pdf/provenance.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>  . You can also access a pdf version of my **resume** <a href="./assets/pdf/resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>
