### 1. Opinion Mining: Covid Vaccine Sentiment Analysis by Geographic Regions

<!-- ###### **Undergraduate Student(s): Ryan Vaughn**
###### **Graduate Student(s): Christopher Kolimago** -->

We explore the sentiments surrounding Covid-19 vaccine adoption on Twitter. We focus on key
regions of the US, particularly urban areas. We utilize machine
learning models such as logistic regression, Support Vector Machines, and Naive Bayes to provide baseline
models. Furthermore, we develop fine-tuned transformer-based language models that provide a
classification of sentiments with high accuracy. 





### 2. Understanding topic discussions on asthma web forums
<!-- ###### **Undergraduate Student: Carter Schmidt** -->

This research involves the use of NLP techniques such as unsupervised machine learning and topic modeling techniques to understand how people living with asthma employ public discussion forums. Also, we  explore
the correlation between predictions such such as the degree of pollen prevalence during a specific season and the frequency of forum discussions. The goal is to understand and use this information to create tools that can better cater to the needs of
asthma patients.


### 3. Graph representation learning for chronic disease prediction in underrepresented populations

This research aims to develop graph-based models that can help uncover insights in patient clinical data in underrepresented groups.
